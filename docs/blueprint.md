## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#003049) to reflect the stability and professionalism required for managing critical network infrastructure.
- Background color: Light gray (#E5E7EB) to provide a neutral and clean backdrop, ensuring readability and focus.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#D62828) to highlight important actions and alerts, ensuring critical information is easily noticeable.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, to ensure readability and a modern, neutral appearance in body text and tables.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font, lending a clean, somewhat technical aesthetic to the headings.
- Use clear and concise icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent actions, statuses, and data types throughout the interface.
- Employ a grid-based layout for consistent alignment and spacing. Use cards or panels to group related information. Prioritize key data fields and actions above the fold.
